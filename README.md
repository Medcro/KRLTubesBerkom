## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome\! If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow the steps below.

### Installing Git

First, you need to have **Git** installed on your computer.

#### Windows üíª

1.  Go to the [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) download page.
2.  An installer will automatically download.
3.  Run the installer and follow the instructions. The default settings are a good choice for most users.

#### macOS üçé

The easiest way to install Git on a Mac is to install the **Xcode Command Line Tools**.

1.  Open the **Terminal** application.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
3.  A pop-up window will appear asking you to install the command line tools. Click "Install".

Alternatively, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install git
```

#### Linux üêß

You can install Git using your distribution's package manager.

  * **Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```
  * **Fedora:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install git
    ```
  * **Arch Linux:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S git
    ```

### Making a Commit

Once you have made changes to the code, here's how you can commit them to the repository.

1.  **Check the status of your changes.** This will show you which files you have modified.

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

2.  **Add the files you want to commit.** You can add all files at once or add them individually.

      * To add all changed files:
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
      * To add a specific file:
        ```bash
        git add <file-name>
        ```

3.  **Commit your changes.** A commit is like a snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time. It's important to write a clear and concise commit message.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
    ```

    For example: `git commit -m "Feat: Add new user authentication feature"`

4.  **Push your changes to the GitHub repository.** This will upload your local commits to the remote repository so that others can see them.

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    *(Note: Your main branch might be named `master` instead of `main`)*.
